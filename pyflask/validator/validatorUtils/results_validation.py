# NOTE: manifest_files present in a dataset alone will not create a path_error_report. Meaning at least one of 
# the other metadata files need to be present in the dataset to have a useful validation report.
# TODO: This begs the question. If the manifest_file is not present in the dataset, but other metadata files are, will the path_error_report notify us of this so we can inform the user?
#       A: No, the path_error_report doesn't tell the user they need to have manifest files in the dataset.
